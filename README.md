## Waiter Tips Analysis

## Overview
Tipping waiters for serving food depends on various factors such as the type of restaurant, the number of people dining, the total bill amount, etc. This repository contains data and analysis related to predicting the tips given to waiters in a restaurant.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is named "tips.csv". It contains the following columns:
1. **total_bill**: Total bill amount in dollars including taxes.
2. **tip**: Tip given to waiters in dollars.
3. **sex**: Gender of the person paying the bill.
4. **smoker**: Whether the person smoked or not.
5. **day**: Day of the week.
6. **time**: Meal time (lunch or dinner).
7. **size**: Number of people in a table.

## Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to explore the factors influencing the tips given to waiters and to build predictive models to estimate tip amounts based on the provided features. Various data science techniques such as data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms will be employed to achieve this objective.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the analysis.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Explore the analysis and findings, and feel free to modify or extend the analysis as needed.
